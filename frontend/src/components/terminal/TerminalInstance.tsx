                    Отступ живёт на обёртке, а не на измеряемом элементе: xterm считает clientHeight
                    вместе с отступами, поэтому при p-2 на самом контейнере терминал влезал на строку
                    больше, чем помещается, и нижняя строка уходила под рамку. Снизу отступ больше,
                    чтобы последняя строка не липла к краю окна. */}
